# Import modules

# Set input variables (Hard-wired)
#read file
inputFile = 'V:/ARGOSTracking/Data/ARGOSData/1997dg.txt' #absolute path; strings that are valid paths because point to file
outputFC = "V:/ARGOSTracking/Scratch/ARGOStrack.shp"
#forward slashes or two backwards slashes can work for file path (if only backwards, has diff function)
#creating points where input and output files are going to live

#%% Construct a while loop to iterate through all lines in the datafile

#Open the ARGOS data file for reading 
inputFileObj = open(inputFile, 'r') #open in read only mode

#Get the first line of data, so we can use a while loop
lineString = inputFileObj.readline() #read first line as string, stores as string

#Start the while loop; want to read large files (doesn't store in memory)
#becomes true (because valid string, text in there) - when done running, sets to null object, making the while loop stop iterating
#when it reaches the end, becomes no data value, which trips the while loop
while lineString: 
    #set code to run only if the line contains the string "Date: "
    if ("Date :" in lineString):

    #moves to this section to execute code if the line doesn't have "Date :"; will skip all the above ^ (no else if statement)
